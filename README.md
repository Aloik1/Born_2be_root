## Introduction

[**View the ESP Version of this Guide**](link-to-esp-version)

Welcome to the **Born_2be_root** project! This guide is designed for anyone who feels lost in their journey with backend coding. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your knowledge, this step-by-step guide will help you navigate and manage a Linux-type system, specifically focusing on Debian. 

This is not a copy-paste guide; I encourage you to read thoroughly and explore alternative methods along the way. This project is rich and rewarding, so don't be deterred by its length. Let's dive in!

## Basic Theory Questions

### What is a VM (Virtual Machine)?

A Virtual Machine (VM) is an application that allows you to install an additional operating system on your physical machine, enabling you to run both simultaneously. 

**Benefits of VMs:**
- **Cost-Effective:** VMs share physical components with your computer, minimizing upkeep costs.
- **Security:** Running a VM mitigates risks to your primary system. For example, if a virus affects the VM, you can easily uninstall it without consequences to your main computer.

### Why Choose Debian or Rocky?

**Debian:**
- More support and flexibility.
- Stable and user-friendly.

**Rocky:**
- Oriented towards enterprises and closer to RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
- Offers advanced security measures and package management through `yum` and `dnf`.

### Differences Between `apt` and `aptitude`

- **`apt`:** Executes commands explicitly as directed.
- **`aptitude`:** A more advanced package manager that differentiates between explicitly requested packages and dependencies. It can uninstall dependencies when they are no longer needed.

### What is AppArmor?

AppArmor is Debianâ€™s default security system that implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). It restricts applications to access only the essential files they need to function, enhancing the overall security of the system.

## Installation

Let's get started with the installation of your Debian system.

1. Visit the [Debian Download Page](https://www.debian.org/download.es.html).
2. Download the appropriate `.iso` file for Debian.
